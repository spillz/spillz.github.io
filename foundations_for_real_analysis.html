<h1>Foundations for Real Analysis</h1>

<p>
This document is a preparatory text for a first rigorous course in Real Analysis.
It is written for readers encountering proof-based mathematics for the first time,
or for readers who have seen calculus but have not previously studied the logical
and structural foundations of the number systems.
</p>

<p>
Most Real Analysis textbooks begin by stating axioms for the real numbers and then
develop limits, continuity, and convergence from those axioms. In doing so, they
necessarily rely on properties of the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers
that are assumed rather than explained. The goal of this text is to make those
assumptions explicit and understandable.
</p>

<p>
We will carefully explain:
how counting leads to the natural numbers,
how subtraction leads to the integers,
how division leads to the rational numbers,
and why the rational numbers are still not sufficient for analysis.
Along the way, we will introduce induction, well-ordering, divisibility,
and infinite descent, with concrete examples and exercises.
</p>

<p>
Nothing in this document requires prior exposure to abstract algebra or set theory.
Where formal constructions are used, they are motivated by simple numerical ideas
and illustrated with examples. The emphasis throughout is on understanding where
the rules come from, not merely learning how to apply them.
</p>

<h2>1. Natural Numbers, Induction, and Well-Ordering</h2>

<p>
We begin with the natural numbers
$\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\dots\}$.
These are the numbers used for counting, ordering, and indexing steps in a process.
They form the backbone of many arguments in analysis, especially those involving
sequences and iterative procedures.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Mathematical induction</h3>

<p>
Mathematical induction formalizes a simple but powerful idea:
if a statement is true at the first step, and if truth at one step forces truth at the next,
then the statement must be true at every step.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Principle of Mathematical Induction.</strong>
Let $P(n)$ be a statement depending on a natural number $n$.
If:
<ol>
<li>$P(1)$ is true, and</li>
<li>for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $P(k)$ implies $P(k+1)$,</li>
</ol>
then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
</div>

<h3>1.2 A concrete example of induction</h3>

<p>
The symbolic form “$P(1)$ and $P(k)\Rightarrow P(k+1)$” can feel abstract.
Here is a complete example that shows how induction works in practice.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
We claim that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$

<strong>Base case.</strong>
For $n=1$, the left-hand side equals $1$, and the right-hand side equals
$\frac{1\cdot2}{2}=1$. The statement is true at $n=1$.

<strong>Inductive step.</strong>
Assume the statement holds for some $k$:
$$
1+2+\cdots+k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}.
$$
Adding $(k+1)$ to both sides gives
$$
1+2+\cdots+k+(k+1)
= \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)
= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}.
$$
This is exactly the formula with $n=k+1$.
</div>

<p>
Induction works because once the statement is true at $1$, the inductive step
forces it to be true at $2$, then $3$, and so on without exception.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 1.</strong>
Use induction to prove that
$$
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2
$$
for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.


<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement $1+3+5+\cdots+(2n-1)=n^2$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Base case.</strong>
    For $n=1$, the left-hand side is $1$ and the right-hand side is $1^2=1$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Inductive step.</strong>
    Assume $P(k)$ holds for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$:
    $$1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)=k^2.$$
    Add the next odd number $2(k+1)-1=2k+1$ to both sides:
    $$1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)+(2k+1)=k^2+(2k+1).$$
    Simplify the right-hand side:
    $$k^2+2k+1=(k+1)^2.$$
    This gives $P(k+1)$.
    By induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>

</div>

<h3>1.3 Well-ordering and why infinite descent is impossible</h3>

<p>
There is another way to express the same structure underlying induction.
Instead of pushing upward step by step, it rules out endless downward motion.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Well-Ordering Principle.</strong>
Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a smallest element.
</div>

<p>
This principle implies that there cannot exist an infinite strictly decreasing sequence
$$
n_0 > n_1 > n_2 > \cdots
$$
of natural numbers. If such a sequence existed, the set
$\{n_0,n_1,n_2,\dots\}$ would have no smallest element,
contradicting well-ordering.
</p>

<p>
Induction and well-ordering are two perspectives on the same underlying fact:
the natural numbers have a beginning, and you cannot keep stepping downward forever.
</p>

<h2>2. Integers as Differences</h2>

<p>
The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ arise when subtraction is required to make sense in all cases.
Expressions like $3-5$ should denote a number, even though $5$ is larger than $3$.
</p>

<p>
Rather than introducing negative numbers as mysterious new symbols,
we explain integers as <em>differences</em>.
</p>

<h3>2.1 Difference pairs</h3>

<p>
Consider ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of natural numbers, intended to represent the difference $a-b$.
Different pairs can represent the same difference. For example,
$$
5-3 = 7-5 = 12-10.
$$
</p>

<p>
To capture this idea formally, we declare two pairs equivalent when they represent
the same net difference.
</p>

<div class="callout">
$(a,b)$ is equivalent to $(c,d)$ if and only if $a+d = b+c$.
</div>

<h3>2.2 Zero and negative integers</h3>

<p>
The integer $0$ corresponds to any pair of the form $(n,n)$, since $n-n=0$.
</p>

<p>
The negative of $(a,b)$ is $(b,a)$, because reversing the order reverses the sign:
$$
a-b = -(b-a).
$$
</p>

<p>
Under this interpretation, negative numbers are not additional objects;
they are simply differences viewed in the opposite direction.
Subtraction and sign rules follow naturally from this construction.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 2.</strong>
Show that adding difference pairs by
$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)$
respects the equivalence relation.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    
<p>
We must show: if $(a,b)\sim(a',b')$ and $(c,d)\sim(c',d')$, then
$$(a+c,b+d)\sim(a'+c',b'+d').$$
</p>
<p>
The hypotheses mean:
$$a+b'=b+a' \quad\text{and}\quad c+d'=d+c'.$$
Add these equalities:
$$(a+b')+(c+d')=(b+a')+(d+c').$$
Regroup:
$$(a+c)+(b'+d')=(b+d)+(a'+c').$$
This is exactly the equivalence condition for
$(a+c,b+d)\sim(a'+c',b'+d')$.
So addition is well-defined on equivalence classes.
</p>

  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h2>3. Rational Numbers as Ratios</h2>

<p>
Rational numbers arise when we want division to be meaningful in all cases.
A rational number is understood as a <em>ratio</em> of two integers.
</p>

<p>
We represent a rational number by a pair $(a,b)$ with $a\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $b\neq0$,
intended to mean $a/b$.
</p>

<p>
Different pairs can represent the same ratio:
$$
1/2 = 2/4 = 50/100.
$$
</p>

<div class="callout">
$(a,b)$ is equivalent to $(c,d)$ if and only if $ad = bc$.
</div>

<p>
This equivalence relation explains fraction equality.
Whenever you clear denominators or simplify fractions, you are implicitly using this rule.
Fraction equality is therefore a consequence of integer multiplication, not a separate idea.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Geometric interpretation.</strong>
Represent $(a,b)$ as the point $(b,a)$ in the plane.
All equivalent fractions lie on the same line through the origin.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 3.</strong>
Verify that addition
$$
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}
$$
is compatible with the equivalence relation.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    
<p>
We want to check that the usual addition formula gives the same rational number no matter which representatives we choose.
Suppose $(a,b)\sim(a',b')$ and $(c,d)\sim(c',d')$, i.e.
$$ab'=a'b \quad\text{and}\quad cd'=c'd.$$
</p>
<p>
Define
$$\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.$$
We must show
$$\frac{ad+bc}{bd} \sim \frac{a'd'+b'c'}{b'd'}.$$
In equivalence-class language this is the integer identity
$$(ad+bc)(b'd')=(a'd'+b'c')(bd).$$
</p>
<p>
Expand both sides:
$$(ad)(b'd')+(bc)(b'd') = (a'd')(bd)+(b'c')(bd).$$
Regroup as
$$a d b' d' + b c b' d' = a' d' b d + b' c' b d.$$
Now use $ab'=a'b$ to replace $ab'$ with $a'b$, and $cd'=c'd$ to replace $cd'$ with $c'd$:
<ul>
<li>$a d b' d' = (ab')(dd') = (a'b)(dd') = a' d' b d$</li>
<li>$b c b' d' = (bb')(c d') = (bb')(c' d) = b' c' b d$</li>
</ul>
Each term matches, so the equality holds. Therefore the addition rule is well-defined.
</p>

  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h2>4. Division Algorithm and the Greatest Common Divisor</h2>

<p>
To control and compare integers, we need a precise notion of division.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Division Algorithm.</strong>
Given integers $a$ and $b>0$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that
$$
a = bq + r, \qquad 0 \le r < b.
$$
</div>

<p>
Repeating the division step produces the Euclidean algorithm.
Its output, the greatest common divisor $\gcd(a,b)$,
is the largest unit that measures both numbers exactly.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
$$
48 = 18\cdot2 + 12, \quad
18 = 12\cdot1 + 6, \quad
12 = 6\cdot2 + 0.
$$
Therefore $\gcd(48,18)=6$.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 4.</strong>
Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute $\gcd(84,30)$ and explain each step.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    
<p>
Apply the Euclidean algorithm:
$$84=30\cdot2+24,$$
$$30=24\cdot1+6,$$
$$24=6\cdot4+0.$$
The last nonzero remainder is $6$, so $\gcd(84,30)=6$.
</p>
<p>
Interpretation: $6$ is the largest integer that divides both $84$ and $30$ exactly.
</p>

  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h2>5. Parity and a First Irrationality Proof</h2>

<p>
Parity distinguishes integers according to whether they are divisible by $2$.
It is the simplest possible notion of divisibility: instead of tracking <em>all</em> factors of a number,
we ask only one yes/no question — “is there a factor of $2$ or not?”
Despite its simplicity, parity is strong enough to force contradictions in many arguments.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Even and odd.</strong>
An integer $n$ is <em>even</em> if $n=2k$ for some integer $k$.
It is <em>odd</em> if $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$.
Every integer is either even or odd, and never both.
</div>

<p>
Parity behaves especially well under squaring, which is why it is useful in irrationality proofs.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Squares preserve parity.</strong>
<ul>
  <li>If $n$ is even, then $n=2k$ and $n^2=(2k)^2=4k^2=2(2k^2)$ is even.</li>
  <li>If $n$ is odd, then $n=2k+1$ and $n^2=(2k+1)^2=4k^2+4k+1=2(2k^2+2k)+1$ is odd.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Thus squaring does not mix parity: even numbers square to even numbers, and odd numbers square to odd numbers.
Equivalently, if a square is even, the original number must already have been even.
This “one-way” implication is exactly what drives the classical contradiction in the proof that
$\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.
</p>


<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 5A.</strong>
Prove that if $n^2$ is divisible by $4$, then $n$ is even.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Suppose $n^2$ is divisible by $4$.
    Then $n^2 = 4k$ for some integer $k$.
    In particular, $n^2$ is even, so $n$ must be even by the parity argument above.
    </p>
    <p>
    Write $n=2m$ for some integer $m$.
    Then $n^2 = 4m^2$, which is divisible by $4$.
    This confirms that divisibility by $4$ at the level of a square forces a factor of $2$
    already to be present in the original number.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Why parity is “minimal but sufficient.”</strong>
In the proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, we only need to track one piece of information:
whether a number has a factor of $2$ or not.
We do <em>not</em> need to know anything about divisibility by $3$, $5$, or other primes.
</div>

<p>
Full prime factorization tells us that every integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes,
and that squaring doubles all prime exponents.
Parity is the special case where we look only at the prime $2$ and ignore everything else.
This is why parity is called a <em>minimal</em> form of divisibility.
</p>

<p>
In the equation
$$
a^2 = 2b^2,
$$
the right-hand side has an odd number of factors of $2$ (one more than $b^2$),
while the left-hand side has an even number of factors of $2$ (twice those in $a$).
Parity alone is enough to see that these two quantities can never be equal.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
Assume $\sqrt{2}=a/b$ with integers $a,b$.
Then $a^2=2b^2$.
If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ is even; write $a=2k$.
Substituting gives $b^2=2k^2$, so $b$ is even.
This produces a smaller pair, contradicting well-ordering.
Therefore $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.
</div>

<h2>6. Infinite Descent</h2>

<p>
Infinite descent is a proof method that exploits well-ordering.
If a supposed counterexample leads to a smaller one, then no counterexample can exist.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
There is no smallest positive rational number.
If $q>0$ were smallest, then $q/2$ would be smaller.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 5.</strong>
Use infinite descent to show there is no smallest positive rational number.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    
<p>
Assume, for contradiction, that there exists a smallest positive rational number. Call it $q$.
Then $q/2$ is also a positive rational number, and $q/2 &lt; q$.
This contradicts the assumption that $q$ was the smallest positive rational.
Therefore there is no smallest positive rational number.
</p>

  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h2>7. Ordered Fields and Completeness</h2>

<p>
An ordered field is a number system equipped with addition, multiplication,
and an order relation that behaves sensibly with respect to these operations.
Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are ordered fields.
</p>


<p>
In practice, “ordered field” means you can do algebra (add, subtract, multiply, divide by nonzero numbers) and you can also compare numbers
(using $&lt;$ and $&gt;$), and these two structures cooperate rather than fight each other.
For example, if you add the same number to both sides of an inequality, the direction of the inequality should not change.
Similarly, multiplying by a positive number should preserve the inequality direction.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Ordered field (informal checklist).</strong>
An ordered field is a set of numbers with:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Addition and multiplication</strong> behaving like ordinary arithmetic (associative, commutative, distributive, with $0$ and $1$, and inverses).</li>
  <li><strong>An order relation</strong> $&lt;$ so that for any $a,b$ exactly one of $a&lt;b$, $a=b$, $a&gt;b$ holds (trichotomy), and the order is transitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility rules</strong> linking algebra and order:
    <ul>
      <li>If $a&lt;b$ then $a+c&lt;b+c$ for all $c$.</li>
      <li>If $0&lt;c$ and $a&lt;b$ then $ac&lt;bc$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example: why $\mathbb{Q}$ is an ordered field.</strong>
Take rational numbers written as fractions (equivalence classes) and use the usual operations.
Define $a&lt;b$ for rationals by saying $b-a$ is positive.
Concretely, if $a=\frac{p}{q}$ and $b=\frac{r}{s}$ with $q,s&gt;0$, then
$$
\frac{p}{q} &lt; \frac{r}{s}
\quad\text{means}\quad
ps &lt; rq.
$$
This is the familiar “cross-multiply” rule, and it is exactly the statement that $b-a$ is positive.
With this definition, adding the same rational to both sides and multiplying by a positive rational preserve inequalities.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 7.</strong>
Let $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Q}$.
<ol>
  <li>Assume $a&lt;b$. Prove that $a+c&lt;b+c$.</li>
  <li>Assume $a&lt;b$ and $0&lt;c$. Prove that $ac&lt;bc$.</li>
</ol>
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    (1) If $a&lt;b$, then by definition $b-a$ is positive.
    Consider $(b+c)-(a+c) = b-a$.
    Since $b-a$ is positive, $(b+c)-(a+c)$ is positive, which means $a+c&lt;b+c$.
    </p>
    <p>
    (2) Assume $a&lt;b$ and $0&lt;c$.
    Since $a&lt;b$, we have $b-a&gt;0$.
    Multiply this positive number by the positive number $c$ to get $c(b-a)&gt;0$.
    Distribute:
    $$c(b-a)=cb-ca.$$
    So $cb-ca&gt;0$, which means $ca&lt;cb$, i.e. $ac&lt;bc$.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
    Note: this solution uses only the idea “$x&lt;y$ means $y-x$ is positive” plus distributivity. In a fully axiomatic treatment,
    these are exactly the compatibility axioms you assume for an ordered field.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<p>
What distinguishes $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ is completeness.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Least Upper Bound Axiom.</strong>
Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound.
</div>

<p>
Completeness fills the gaps present in $\mathbb{Q}$ and ensures that limits behave as expected.
</p>

<h2>8. Sets, Functions, and Sequences</h2>

<p>
A function assigns exactly one output to each input.
A sequence is simply a function from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{R}$.
</p>

<p>
Understanding quantifiers is essential in analysis.
For example, the definition of convergence states:
$$
\forall \varepsilon \,\gt\, 0 \; \exists N \; \forall n \,\gt\, N :
|a_n - L| \,\lt\, \varepsilon.
$$
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 6.</strong>
Rewrite the definition of convergence in words,
explicitly describing who chooses $\varepsilon$, who chooses $N$,
and what depends on what.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    
<p>
The statement
$$\forall \varepsilon &gt; 0 \; \exists N \; \forall n &gt; N : |a_n-L| &lt; \varepsilon$$
means:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You (or an adversary) pick any tolerance $\varepsilon&gt;0$ (how close you want to be to $L$).</li>
<li>After seeing that choice, we must produce a cutoff index $N$.</li>
<li>Once $N$ is chosen, <em>every</em> index $n$ beyond $N$ satisfies $|a_n-L|&lt;\varepsilon$.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In words: <em>no matter how small an error tolerance you demand, eventually all terms of the sequence stay within that tolerance of $L$.</em>
