<h1>Foundations for Real Analysis</h1>

<p>
This document is a preparatory text for a first rigorous course in Real Analysis.
It is written for readers who have seen calculus computations but are new to proof-based mathematics,
and for readers who want the logical and structural foundations of the number systems made explicit.
</p>

<p>
Most Real Analysis courses begin with the real numbers and build limits, continuity, and convergence.
That development relies on facts about the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers that are often assumed.
Here we make those assumptions visible, and we practice the proof techniques that will be used constantly in analysis.
</p>

<p>
Along the way, we will:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>explain induction and well-ordering on $\mathbb{N}$,</li>
  <li>introduce basic set language (so that constructions like “equivalence classes” are readable),</li>
  <li>construct $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ using equivalence relations,</li>
  <li>practice divisibility arguments (including a first irrationality proof),</li>
  <li>explain proof styles such as contradiction and contrapositive,</li>
  <li>see why $\mathbb{Q}$ is not sufficient for analysis, and</li>
  <li>learn how quantified definitions lead to $\varepsilon$–$N$ and $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs.</li>
</ul>

Technical note: this HTML file uses MathJax to render mathematics. If you open the file while offline or behind a firewall that blocks CDNs,
the MathJax library may not load and you may see raw LaTeX (for example, <code>\forall</code> or <code>\sqrt{2}</code>) instead of formatted equations.
To fix that, open the file with an internet connection, or replace the MathJax script tag above with a local copy of MathJax.
</p>

<h2>0. What Is a Proof?</h2>

<p>
In mathematics, a <em>proof</em> is not an experiment, a calculation, or an explanation meant to convince by example.
A proof is a logical argument that starts from agreed-upon assumptions and definitions, and reaches a conclusion by steps that are valid in all cases.
</p>

<p>
This distinction matters.
In calculus, it is often acceptable to check formulas numerically, draw graphs, or rely on geometric intuition.
In Real Analysis, this is no longer enough.
A statement must be shown to follow logically from what is assumed, not merely to agree with computations or pictures.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>What is assumed in a proof?</strong>
A proof rests on three kinds of assumptions, not one:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Axioms (global assumptions).</strong>
    These are the background rules of the number system and of logic itself.
    Examples include the algebraic and order properties of the real numbers,
    and the completeness property (such as the existence of least upper bounds).
    Axioms are not restated inside individual proofs; they form the environment in which all arguments take place.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Definitions (meaning-fixing assumptions).</strong>
    Definitions specify what words and symbols mean.
    They are not assumptions about truth, but agreements about language.
    Examples include what “even,” “limit,” or “Cauchy sequence” mean.
    Much of Real Analysis consists of carefully unpacking definitions and following their consequences.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hypotheses (local assumptions).</strong>
    These are the specific conditions stated in the theorem or proposition being proved.
    Examples include “let $(a_n)$ be a sequence of real numbers,”
    “assume $x^2<2$,” or “let $\varepsilon>0$ be given.”
    These are the assumptions you may use in the proof—and no others.
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
A correct proof makes clear which assumptions are being used at each step.
It does not rely on hidden facts, special cases, or numerical experimentation.
When a conclusion is reached, it must hold for every object satisfying the stated hypotheses.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
The identity
$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
can be checked numerically for small values of $n$.
But a proof by induction shows that once the formula holds at the starting point,
and once correctness at one step forces correctness at the next,
the identity must hold for all natural numbers.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise.</strong>
Explain why checking that a statement holds for the first 100 natural numbers does <em>not</em> constitute a proof that it holds for all natural numbers.
Write your answer in complete sentences.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Checking finitely many cases only shows that the statement holds for those specific values.
    It gives no information about what happens beyond the values checked.
    A proof must rule out the possibility that the statement fails at some later value.
    Induction does this by showing that failure at any step would force failure earlier, which contradicts the verified base case.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<p>
As you read the rest of this document, and later a Real Analysis textbook,
you should continually ask:
“What assumptions are in force here?” and
“Which definition is being used at this step?”
Learning to track these dependencies is one of the central skills of Real Analysis.
</p>


<h2>1. Natural Numbers, Induction, and Well-Ordering</h2>

<p>
We begin with the natural numbers
$\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\dots\}$.
These are the numbers used for counting, ordering, and indexing steps in a process.
They form the backbone of many arguments in analysis, especially those involving sequences and iterative procedures.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Mathematical induction</h3>

<p>
Mathematical induction formalizes a simple but powerful idea:
if a statement is true at the first step, and if truth at one step forces truth at the next,
then the statement must be true at every step.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Principle of Mathematical Induction.</strong>
Let $P(n)$ be a statement depending on a natural number $n$.
If:
<ol>
<li>$P(1)$ is true, and</li>
<li>for every $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $P(k)$ implies $P(k+1)$,</li>
</ol>
then $P(n)$ is true for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
</div>

<h3>1.2 A concrete example of induction</h3>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
We claim that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$,
$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
$$

<strong>Base case.</strong>
For $n=1$, the left-hand side equals $1$, and the right-hand side equals
$\frac{1\cdot2}{2}=1$.

<strong>Inductive step.</strong>
Assume the statement holds for some $k$:
$$
1+2+\cdots+k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}.
$$
Adding $(k+1)$ to both sides gives
$$
1+2+\cdots+k+(k+1)
= \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)
= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}.
$$
This is exactly the formula with $n=k+1$.
</div>

<p>
Induction works because once the statement is true at $1$, the inductive step forces it to be true at $2$, then $3$, and so on.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 1.</strong>
Use induction to prove that
$$
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2
$$
for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Let $P(n)$ be the statement $1+3+5+\cdots+(2n-1)=n^2$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Base case.</strong>
    For $n=1$, the left-hand side is $1$ and the right-hand side is $1^2=1$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Inductive step.</strong>
    Assume $P(k)$ holds for some $k\in\mathbb{N}$:
    $$
    1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)=k^2.
    $$
    Add the next odd number $2(k+1)-1=2k+1$ to both sides:
    $$
    1+3+\cdots+(2k-1)+(2k+1)=k^2+(2k+1).
    $$
    Simplify the right-hand side:
    $$
    k^2+2k+1=(k+1)^2.
    $$
    This gives $P(k+1)$.
    By induction, $P(n)$ holds for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
    </p>
  </div>

</div>

<h3>1.3 Inequalities: a basic toolkit you will use constantly</h3>

<p>
Real Analysis proofs frequently depend on bounding one expression by another.
In calculus, inequalities often appear only as side work. In analysis, they are a primary tool.
This subsection introduces a few patterns that appear over and over.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Three inequality patterns.</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Triangle inequality:</strong> for any real numbers $x,y$, $|x+y|\le |x|+|y|$.</li>
  <li><strong>Reverse triangle inequality:</strong> $||x|-|y||\le |x-y|$.</li>
  <li><strong>Bounding by something simpler:</strong> if $0\le u\le v$ then $u^2\le v^2$ and $|u|\le |v|$.</li>
</ul>
These are not “tricks.” They are standard moves that let you replace a complicated expression with a controllable one.
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
Show that $|x^2-y^2|\le (|x|+|y|)\,|x-y|$ for all real numbers $x,y$.
<p>
<strong>Reason.</strong> Factor and then apply the triangle inequality:
$$
|x^2-y^2| = |(x-y)(x+y)| = |x-y|\cdot|x+y| \le |x-y|(|x|+|y|).
$$
</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 2.</strong>
Let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$.
Prove that
$$
|x-y|\ge \bigl||x|-|y|\bigr|.
$$
Then explain in one sentence why this inequality is useful when you want to show that a sequence cannot converge to two different limits.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Starting from the triangle inequality,
    $$
    |x| = |(x-y)+y| \le |x-y|+|y|,
    $$
    so $|x|-|y|\le |x-y|$.
    Swapping the roles of $x$ and $y$ gives $|y|-|x|\le |x-y|$.
    Combining these yields
    $$
    -|x-y|\le |x|-|y|\le |x-y|,
    $$
    which is exactly $||x|-|y||\le |x-y|$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Usefulness.</strong>
    If a sequence were close to two different limits $L$ and $M$, then $|L-M|$ would have to be small because
    $|L-M|\le |L-a_n|+|a_n-M|$; this is one standard way to prove limits are unique.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h3>1.4 Well-ordering and why infinite descent is impossible</h3>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Well-Ordering Principle.</strong>
Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{N}$ has a smallest element.
</div>

<p>
This principle implies that there cannot exist an infinite strictly decreasing sequence
$$
n_0 > n_1 > n_2 > \cdots
$$
of natural numbers. If such a sequence existed, the set
$\{n_0,n_1,n_2,\dots\}$ would have no smallest element,
contradicting well-ordering.
</p>

<p>
Induction and well-ordering are two perspectives on the same underlying fact:
the natural numbers have a beginning, and you cannot keep stepping downward forever.
</p>


<h2>2. Sets as Collections</h2>

<p>
Real Analysis is written in the language of sets. Even the familiar number systems
$\mathbb{N},\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Q},\mathbb{R}$ are sets.
To read and write proofs, you need a small set of basic operations and proof patterns.
</p>

<h3>2.1 Elements, subsets, and set-builder notation</h3>

<p>
If $A$ is a set, the notation $x\in A$ means “$x$ is an element of $A$.”
The notation $A\subseteq B$ means “every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.”
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
The statement $\mathbb{N}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}$ means that every natural number is an integer.
It does <em>not</em> mean that $\mathbb{N}$ is a single integer.
</div>

<p>
Set-builder notation describes sets by a property:
$$
\{x\in\mathbb{R} : x^2 < 2\}
$$
means “the set of real numbers whose square is less than $2$.”
</p>

<h3>2.2 Unions, intersections, and complements</h3>

<div class="callout">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Union:</strong> $A\cup B=\{x : x\in A \text{ or } x\in B\}$.</li>
  <li><strong>Intersection:</strong> $A\cap B=\{x : x\in A \text{ and } x\in B\}$.</li>
  <li><strong>Complement (relative to a universe $U$):</strong> $A^c = U\setminus A=\{x\in U : x\notin A\}$.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 3.</strong>
Let $A,B,C$ be subsets of a universe set $U$.
Prove that
$$
A\cap(B\cup C) = (A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C).
$$
This identity is called <em>distributivity</em> of $\cap$ over $\cup$.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    We prove two inclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>($\subseteq$)</strong> Let $x\in A\cap(B\cup C)$. Then $x\in A$ and $x\in (B\cup C)$.
    So $x\in B$ or $x\in C$.
    If $x\in B$, then $x\in A\cap B$; if $x\in C$, then $x\in A\cap C$.
    In either case $x\in (A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>($\supseteq$)</strong> Let $x\in (A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$.
    Then either $x\in A\cap B$ or $x\in A\cap C$.
    In both cases $x\in A$, and also $x\in B$ or $x\in C$.
    Therefore $x\in B\cup C$, and hence $x\in A\cap(B\cup C)$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h3>2.3 Equivalence relations and equivalence classes</h3>

<p>
An <em>equivalence relation</em> is a rule that declares when two objects should be regarded as “the same” for some purpose.
For example, the fractions $1/2$ and $2/4$ are not the same pair of integers, but they represent the same rational number.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Equivalence relation (informal).</strong>
A relation $\sim$ on a set $S$ is an equivalence relation if it behaves like “sameness”:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reflexive:</strong> $x\sim x$ for all $x\in S$.</li>
  <li><strong>Symmetric:</strong> if $x\sim y$ then $y\sim x$.</li>
  <li><strong>Transitive:</strong> if $x\sim y$ and $y\sim z$ then $x\sim z$.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Given an element $x\in S$, its <em>equivalence class</em> is the subset
$$
[x]=\{y\in S : y\sim x\}.
$$
Equivalence classes are sets. In the constructions of $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ below,
each “number” will be an entire equivalence class.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 4.</strong>
Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on a set $S$.
Show that if $x\sim y$, then $[x]=[y]$.
In other words, equivalent elements determine the same equivalence class.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Assume $x\sim y$. We prove $[x]\subseteq [y]$ and $[y]\subseteq [x]$.
    </p>
    <p>
    Let $z\in [x]$. Then $z\sim x$ by definition of $[x]$.
    Since $x\sim y$ and $\sim$ is symmetric, we also have $y\sim x$.
    By transitivity, $z\sim x$ and $x\sim y$ imply $z\sim y$.
    Hence $z\in [y]$. So $[x]\subseteq [y]$.
    </p>
    <p>
    The reverse inclusion is similar: if $z\in [y]$ then $z\sim y$, and with $y\sim x$ we get $z\sim x$, so $z\in [x]$.
    Therefore $[x]=[y]$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<p>
Equivalence relations and equivalence classes are useful whenever we want to treat different
objects as “the same” for a specific purpose, while still keeping track of how they were built.
This happens constantly in mathematics: we often have multiple representations of a single concept.
</p>

<p>
For example, the fractions $1/2$ and $2/4$ are different pairs of integers, but they represent the same ratio.
Likewise, the subtraction expressions $5-3$ and $12-10$ look different, but they represent the same net difference.
An equivalence relation is the formal device that tells us precisely when two representations should be identified.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Equivalence matters.</strong>
Equivalence relations let us build new number systems (and many other objects) by:
<ul>
  <li>starting with concrete representations we understand (like pairs of integers),</li>
  <li>declaring when two representations mean the same thing (an equivalence relation), and</li>
  <li>treating each entire equivalence class as a single new object (a “number”).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This is also how we keep arithmetic consistent.
When we define addition or multiplication on these new objects, we must be sure the result does not depend on which representative we picked.
The phrase <em>well-defined</em> means exactly this: if two representations are equivalent, then performing an operation on them gives equivalent results.
The exercises in the next sections practice this idea.
</p>


<h2>3. Integers as Differences</h2>

<p>
The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ arise when subtraction must make sense in all cases.
In the natural numbers, expressions like $3-5$ are not defined.
Yet we clearly want such expressions to denote numbers.
</p>

<p>
Rather than introducing negative numbers as unfamiliar new symbols,
we construct the integers by making the idea of a <em>difference</em> precise.
</p>

<h3>3.1 Difference pairs</h3>

<p>
Consider ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of natural numbers, intended to represent the difference $a-b$.
The key point is that many different calculations can produce the same difference. For example,
</p>

$$
5-3 = 7-5 = 12-10.
$$

<p>
If we want to model “difference” itself, we must regard all of these as representing the same integer.
</p>

<p>
To formalize this idea, we declare two pairs equivalent when they encode the same net difference.
</p>

<div class="callout">
$(a,b)$ is equivalent to $(c,d)$ if and only if $a+d = b+c$.
</div>

<p>
An integer is therefore not a single pair, but the entire equivalence class of pairs that share the same difference.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Zero and negative integers</h3>

<p>
The integer $0$ corresponds to any pair of the form $(n,n)$, since $n-n=0$.
All such pairs are equivalent, reflecting the fact that zero represents perfect balance.
</p>

<p>
Negation has a simple interpretation: if $(a,b)$ represents $a-b$, then swapping entries gives $(b,a)$, representing $-(a-b)$.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 5.</strong>
Show that adding difference pairs by
$(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)$
respects the equivalence relation (so addition is well-defined on equivalence classes).
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    We must show that if $(a,b)\sim(a',b')$ and $(c,d)\sim(c',d')$, then
    $(a+c,b+d)\sim(a'+c',b'+d')$.
    </p>
    <p>
    The hypotheses mean:
    $$
    a+b' = b+a'
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    c+d' = d+c'.
    $$
    Adding these equalities gives
    $$
    (a+b')+(c+d') = (b+a')+(d+c').
    $$
    Rearranging terms yields
    $$
    (a+c)+(b'+d') = (b+d)+(a'+c').
    $$
    This is exactly the equivalence condition for
    $(a+c,b+d)\sim(a'+c',b'+d')$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>


<h2>4. Rational Numbers as Ratios</h2>

<p>
Rational numbers arise when we want division to be meaningful in all cases.
A rational number is understood as a <em>ratio</em> of two integers.
We represent it by a pair $(a,b)$ with $a\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $b\neq0$, intended to mean $a/b$.
</p>

<p>
Different pairs can represent the same ratio:
$$
1/2 = 2/4 = 50/100.
$$
</p>

<div class="callout">
$(a,b)$ is equivalent to $(c,d)$ if and only if $ad = bc$.
</div>

<p>
This equivalence relation explains fraction equality: whenever you clear denominators or simplify fractions, you are using this rule.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Geometric interpretation.</strong>
Plot the integer point $(b,a)$ in the plane. Then all pairs that represent the same rational number lie on the same line through the origin:
they have the same slope because $\frac{a}{b}$ is the slope of the line from $(0,0)$ to $(b,a)$.
</div>

<div class="callout">
<canvas id="ratPlane" width="760" height="360" style="width:100%; max-width:760px; border:1px solid #ddd; border-radius:10px; background:#fff;"></canvas>
<div class="muted" style="margin-top:8px;">
The plot shows integer points $(b,a)$ for a few equivalent fractions. Points on the same ray from the origin represent the same ratio $a/b$.
</div>
</div>

Verify that addition

<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    We want to check that the usual addition formula gives the same rational number no matter which representatives we choose.
    Suppose $(a,b)\sim(a',b')$ and $(c,d)\sim(c',d')$, i.e.
    $$ab'=a'b \quad\text{and}\quad cd'=c'd.$$
    </p>
    <p>
    Define
    $$\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.$$
    We must show
    $$\frac{ad+bc}{bd} \sim \frac{a'd'+b'c'}{b'd'}.$$
    In equivalence-class language this is the integer identity
    $$(ad+bc)(b'd')=(a'd'+b'c')(bd).$$
    </p>
    <p>
    Expand both sides:
    $$(ad)(b'd')+(bc)(b'd') = (a'd')(bd)+(b'c')(bd).$$
    Regroup as
    $$a d b' d' + b c b' d' = a' d' b d + b' c' b d.$$
    Now use $ab'=a'b$ to replace $ab'$ with $a'b$, and $cd'=c'd$ to replace $cd'$ with $c'd$.
    The matching terms agree, so the equality holds. Therefore the addition rule is well-defined.

<h2>5. Divisibility, Parity, and a First Irrationality Proof</h2>

<p>
Divisibility is a way of tracking which integers “fit into” others.
It is central to number theory, but it also provides clean proof practice that transfers directly to analysis:
you learn how to make precise definitions and then push them through logical consequences.
</p>

<h3>5.1 Division algorithm and the greatest common divisor</h3>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Division Algorithm.</strong>
Given integers $a$ and $b>0$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that
$$
a = bq + r, \qquad 0 \le r < b.
$$
</div>

<p>
Repeating the division step produces the Euclidean algorithm.
Its output, the greatest common divisor $\gcd(a,b)$,
is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
$$
48 = 18\cdot2 + 12,\quad
18 = 12\cdot1 + 6,\quad
12 = 6\cdot2 + 0.
$$
Therefore $\gcd(48,18)=6$.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 7.</strong>
Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute $\gcd(84,30)$ and explain each step.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Apply the Euclidean algorithm:
    $$84=30\cdot2+24,$$
    $$30=24\cdot1+6,$$
    $$24=6\cdot4+0.$$
    The last nonzero remainder is $6$, so $\gcd(84,30)=6$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h3>5.2 Parity</h3>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Even and odd.</strong>
An integer $n$ is <em>even</em> if $n=2k$ for some integer $k$.
It is <em>odd</em> if $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$.
Every integer is either even or odd, and never both.
</div>

<p>
Parity behaves especially well under squaring.
If $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even, and if $n$ is odd then $n^2$ is odd.
Equivalently, if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ must already be even.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 8.</strong>
Prove that if $n^2$ is divisible by $4$, then $n$ is even.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Suppose $n^2$ is divisible by $4$, so $n^2=4k$ for some integer $k$.
    In particular $n^2$ is even. If $n$ were odd, then $n^2$ would be odd, a contradiction.
    Therefore $n$ is even.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h3>5.3 A first irrationality proof: $\sqrt{2}\notin\mathbb{Q}$</h3>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example (proof by contradiction).</strong>
Assume $\sqrt{2}=a/b$ with integers $a,b$ and $b\neq 0$.
Then $a^2=2b^2$.
If $a^2$ is even, then $a$ is even; write $a=2k$.
Substituting gives $b^2=2k^2$, so $b$ is even as well.
Thus both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $2$, meaning the fraction $a/b$ was not in lowest terms.
This contradicts the assumption that we chose a reduced representation.
Therefore $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 9.</strong>
Fill in the missing justification in the argument above: why is it legitimate to assume, at the start, that $a/b$ is in lowest terms?
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Any rational number can be written as a fraction of integers, and among all such representations
    we can choose one where the denominator is positive and the greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator is $1$.
    (For example, divide numerator and denominator by $\gcd(a,b)$.) This is called a reduced or lowest-terms form.
    Therefore, if $\sqrt{2}$ were rational, it would have at least one representation $a/b$ with $\gcd(a,b)=1$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>


<h2>6. Infinite Descent and Proof Styles</h2>

<p>
Infinite descent is a proof method that exploits well-ordering on the natural numbers.
It is closely related to induction, but it runs “downward”: it shows that a hypothetical example would force a smaller example, and therefore a smaller one again, and so on.
Since the natural numbers cannot decrease forever, the original assumption must have been false.
</p>

<h3>6.1 Why infinite descent works</h3>

<p>
Suppose we assume that a certain kind of object exists.
If we can show that any such object would give rise to a <em>smaller</em> object of the same kind, then there can be no smallest one.
This contradicts well-ordering, so the original assumption must be false.
</p>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example.</strong>
There is no smallest positive rational number.
<p>
<strong>Reason.</strong>
If $q&gt;0$ is rational, then $q/2&gt;0$ is rational and $q/2&lt;q$.
So no positive rational can be “smallest.”
</p>
</div>

<h3>6.2 Proof styles you will see constantly</h3>

<p>
Real Analysis uses a small number of proof patterns repeatedly.
Naming them helps you recognize what a proof is doing.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Common proof patterns.</strong>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direct proof:</strong> start from the hypotheses and use definitions and algebra to reach the conclusion.</li>
  <li><strong>Proof by contradiction:</strong> assume the conclusion is false (or assume the opposite statement), then derive an impossibility.</li>
  <li><strong>Contrapositive:</strong> to prove “if $P$ then $Q$,” it is often easier to prove “if not $Q$ then not $P$.” These are logically equivalent.</li>
  <li><strong>Existence by construction:</strong> explicitly build the object and verify it has the desired properties.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example (contrapositive).</strong>
Proposition: If $x^2&lt;1$, then $|x|&lt;1$.
<p>
A contrapositive proof starts from the negation of the conclusion: assume $|x|\ge 1$.
Then $x^2 \ge 1$, so it is not true that $x^2&lt;1$.
Therefore, if $x^2&lt;1$ holds, we must have $|x|&lt;1$.
</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 10.</strong>
Prove the statement “If $x$ is irrational, then $x+1$ is irrational.”
Do this in two ways:
<ol>
  <li>by contradiction, and</li>
  <li>by proving the contrapositive.</li>
</ol>
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    <strong>(1) Contradiction.</strong>
    Assume $x$ is irrational but $x+1$ is rational.
    Then $x = (x+1)-1$ would be a difference of rationals, hence rational.
    This contradicts that $x$ is irrational.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>(2) Contrapositive.</strong>
    The contrapositive of “if $x$ is irrational then $x+1$ is irrational” is:
    “if $x+1$ is rational then $x$ is rational.”
    If $x+1$ is rational, then subtracting $1$ (which is rational) shows $x=(x+1)-1$ is rational.
    Therefore the contrapositive is true, so the original statement is true.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>


<h2>7. Why the Rationals Are Not Sufficient for Analysis</h2>

<p>
Real Analysis is largely about <em>limits</em>. A basic expectation is that if a sequence of numbers
gets tighter and tighter—its terms eventually become arbitrarily close to each other—then it should converge toward a definite number.
This expectation is correct in $\mathbb{R}$ but false in $\mathbb{Q}$.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Cauchy sequence (informal preview).</strong>
A sequence $(a_n)$ is called <em>Cauchy</em> if its terms eventually get arbitrarily close to one another:
for every tolerance $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is an index $N$ such that whenever $m,n&gt;N$ we have
$|a_n-a_m|&lt;\varepsilon$.
<br><br>
Intuition: past some point, the sequence “bunches up.” It ought to be approaching a limit—unless your number system has holes.
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example: a rational sequence that converges to $\sqrt{2}$ (but not inside $\mathbb{Q}$).</strong>
<p>
Define a sequence of rationals by starting at $a_1=1$ and iterating
</p>
$$
a_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(a_n+\frac{2}{a_n}\right).
$$
<p>
This is Newton’s method applied to $x^2=2$. Each $a_n$ is rational, and the values quickly approach $1.41421\ldots$,
which is $\sqrt{2}$. In $\mathbb{R}$ the sequence converges to $\sqrt{2}$, but $\sqrt{2}\notin\mathbb{Q}$,
so the sequence has no limit in $\mathbb{Q}$.
</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 11.</strong>
Let $(a_n)$ be the sequence of decimal truncations of $\sqrt{2}$:
$$
a_1=1,\quad a_2=1.4,\quad a_3=1.41,\quad a_4=1.414,\quad \dots
$$
so that $a_n$ is the rational number obtained by cutting $\sqrt{2}$ off after $n-1$ decimal places.
<p>
(a) Show that $(a_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{Q}$ (use only elementary bounds on decimals).<br>
(b) Explain why $(a_n)$ cannot converge to any rational number.
</p>
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    <strong>(a) Cauchy.</strong>
    Fix $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Choose $N$ so large that $10^{-(N-1)}&lt;\varepsilon$.
    For $m,n\ge N$, the decimals $a_m$ and $a_n$ agree through $N-1$ places.
    Therefore their difference is less than $10^{-(N-1)}$, hence less than $\varepsilon$.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>(b) No rational limit.</strong>
    In $\mathbb{R}$, the truncation sequence converges to $\sqrt{2}$.
    If it converged to a rational $q$, then as a real sequence it would also converge to $q$.
    But limits in $\mathbb{R}$ are unique, so $q=\sqrt{2}$, contradicting $\sqrt{2}\notin\mathbb{Q}$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<p>
This is a concrete reason $\mathbb{Q}$ is not enough for analysis:
there are sequences of rationals whose behavior demands a limit, but the limit is not rational.
Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ is the systematic repair of this defect.
</p>


<h2>8. Ordered Fields and Completeness</h2>

<p>
An ordered field is a number system equipped with addition, multiplication,
and an order relation that behaves sensibly with respect to these operations.
Both $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ are ordered fields.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Ordered field (informal checklist).</strong>
An ordered field is a set of numbers with:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Addition and multiplication</strong> behaving like ordinary arithmetic (associative, commutative, distributive, with $0$ and $1$, and inverses).</li>
  <li><strong>An order relation</strong> $\lt$ so that for any $a,b$ exactly one of $a\lt b$, $a=b$, $a\gt b$ holds (trichotomy), and the order is transitive.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility rules</strong> linking algebra and order:
    <ul>
      <li>If $a\lt b$ then $a+c\lt b+c$ for all $c$.</li>
      <li>If $0\lt c$ and $a\lt b$ then $ac\lt bc$.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
What distinguishes $\mathbb{R}$ from $\mathbb{Q}$ is completeness.
One standard completeness axiom is the least upper bound property.
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Least Upper Bound Axiom.</strong>
Every nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}$ that is bounded above has a least upper bound (supremum).
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example: a supremum that is not a maximum.</strong>
Let
$$
A=\{x\in\mathbb{R}: x^2&lt;2\}.
$$
Then $A$ is bounded above (for instance, by $2$), and it has a least upper bound.
In fact, $\sup A = \sqrt{2}$.
However, $\sqrt{2}\notin A$ because $\sqrt{2}^2=2$ is not strictly less than $2$.
So $A$ has a supremum but no largest element.
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 12.</strong>
Let $A=(0,1)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:0&lt;x&lt;1\}$.
<p>
(a) Show that $A$ is bounded above and has no maximum element.<br>
(b) Find $\sup A$ and justify your answer using the definition of least upper bound.
</p>
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    <strong>(a)</strong>
    The set $A$ is bounded above by $1$ because every $x\in A$ satisfies $x&lt;1$.
    It has no maximum: if $x\in(0,1)$ then $(x+1)/2$ is also in $(0,1)$ and satisfies $x&lt;(x+1)/2$.
    So no element can be the largest.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>(b)</strong>
    We claim $\sup A = 1$.
    First, $1$ is an upper bound by part (a).
    Second, if $u&lt;1$ then $u$ is not an upper bound because we can choose $x=(u+1)/2$.
    This $x$ satisfies $u&lt;x&lt;1$, so $x\in A$ but $x&gt;u$.
    Therefore no number smaller than $1$ is an upper bound, so $1$ is the least upper bound.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>


<h2>9. Quantifiers and $\varepsilon$-Proofs</h2>

<p>
Nearly every definition in Real Analysis is a quantified statement.
Being able to read quantifiers correctly—and then use them to build proofs—is a core skill.
</p>

<h3>9.1 Reading quantified definitions</h3>

<p>
Consider the formal definition of the limit of a sequence:
</p>

$$
\forall \varepsilon &gt; 0 \; \exists N \in \mathbb{N} \; \forall n &gt; N:\ |a_n - L| &lt; \varepsilon.
$$

<p>
This does <em>not</em> mean that a single tolerance is fixed once and for all.
Instead, it asserts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>For <em>every</em> tolerance $\varepsilon&gt;0$, no matter how small,</li>
  <li>there exists an index $N$ (which may depend on that $\varepsilon$),</li>
  <li>such that once this $N$ is chosen, the inequality holds for <em>all</em> $n&gt;N$.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can think of it as a “challenge-response” structure: someone hands you $\varepsilon$, and you must respond with an $N$ that works.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 13.</strong>
Consider the sequence $a_n = 1/n$.
Explain, in words, how you would choose $N$ after being given a specific $\varepsilon &gt; 0$.
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    We want $|1/n-0|&lt;\varepsilon$, which means $1/n&lt;\varepsilon$.
    This is equivalent to $n&gt;1/\varepsilon$.
    So after being given $\varepsilon$, choose any integer $N$ larger than $1/\varepsilon$.
    Then for all $n&gt;N$ we have $1/n&lt;1/N&lt;\varepsilon$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h3>9.2 Turning the definition into a proof: a full $\varepsilon$–$N$ example</h3>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example (a complete $\varepsilon$–$N$ proof).</strong>
Prove that $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0$.
<p>
<strong>Proof.</strong>
Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ be given.
We want to make $|1/n-0|=1/n$ smaller than $\varepsilon$.
So we want $1/n&lt;\varepsilon$, which is equivalent to $n&gt;1/\varepsilon$.
Choose a natural number $N$ such that $N&gt;1/\varepsilon$.
Then for every $n&gt;N$, we have $n&gt;N$ and therefore $1/n&lt;1/N&lt;\varepsilon$.
Hence $|1/n-0|&lt;\varepsilon$ for all $n&gt;N$, which is exactly the definition of convergence to $0$.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Notice the structure: we begin with what we want ($|a_n-L|&lt;\varepsilon$) and solve inequalities until we can state a choice of $N$.
This “work backward, then write forward” pattern is normal in analysis.
</p>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 14.</strong>
Use the $\varepsilon$–$N$ definition to prove that
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{3n+1}{n}=3.
$$
Your proof must:
<ul>
  <li>start by fixing an arbitrary $\varepsilon&gt;0$,</li>
  <li>choose an explicit $N$ in terms of $\varepsilon$, and</li>
  <li>verify the inequality for all $n&gt;N$.</li>
</ul>
<details class="callout">
  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ be given.
    We have
    $$
    \left|\frac{3n+1}{n}-3\right| = \left|3+\frac{1}{n}-3\right|=\frac{1}{n}.
    $$
    So we want $1/n&lt;\varepsilon$, which is equivalent to $n&gt;1/\varepsilon$.
    Choose $N\in\mathbb{N}$ with $N&gt;1/\varepsilon$.
    Then for all $n&gt;N$ we have $1/n&lt;1/N&lt;\varepsilon$.
    Therefore $\left|\frac{3n+1}{n}-3\right|&lt;\varepsilon$ for all $n&gt;N$,
    so the limit is $3$.
    </p>
  </div>
</details>
</div>

<h3>9.3 From sequences to functions: the $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition</h3>

<p>
Limits of functions are defined similarly, but now the index $n$ is replaced by a real input $x$.
The idea is: if $x$ is close to $a$, then $f(x)$ should be close to $L$.
The definition records exactly how close is “close enough.”
</p>

<div class="callout">
<strong>Limit of a function (informal statement).</strong>
We say $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=L$ if for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a $\delta&gt;0$ such that
whenever $0&lt;|x-a|&lt;\delta$ we have $|f(x)-L|&lt;\varepsilon$.
</div>

<div class="example">
<strong>Example (a complete $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proof).</strong>
Prove that $\lim_{x\to 2} (3x+1)=7$.
<p>
<strong>Proof.</strong>
Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ be given.
We want $|(3x+1)-7|&lt;\varepsilon$ whenever $x$ is close to $2$.
Compute:
$$
|(3x+1)-7| = |3x-6| = 3|x-2|.
$$
So it is enough to ensure $3|x-2|&lt;\varepsilon$.
This will hold if $|x-2|&lt;\varepsilon/3$.
Therefore choose $\delta=\varepsilon/3$.
Then whenever $0&lt;|x-2|&lt;\delta$, we have
$$
|(3x+1)-7| = 3|x-2| &lt; 3\delta = 3(\varepsilon/3)=\varepsilon.
$$
This proves $\lim_{x\to 2}(3x+1)=7$.
</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
<strong>Exercise 15.</strong>
Use the $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ definition to prove that
$$
\lim_{x\to 1} x^2 = 1.
$$
Hint: factor $x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)$ and use a bound on $|x+1|$ when $x$ is close to $1$.

  <summary><strong>Solution (click to expand)</strong></summary>
  <div style="margin-top:10px">
    <p>
    Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ be given. We need $|x^2-1|&lt;\varepsilon$ when $0&lt;|x-1|&lt;\delta$.
    Factor:
    $$
    |x^2-1| = |x-1||x+1|.
    $$
    The issue is that $|x+1|$ depends on $x$, so we bound it by forcing $x$ into a small neighborhood of $1$.
    Require $|x-1|&lt;1$. Then $x\in(0,2)$ and so $|x+1|&lt;3$.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now if we also ensure $|x-1|&lt;\varepsilon/3$, then
    $$
    |x^2-1| = |x-1||x+1| &lt; (\varepsilon/3)\cdot 3 = \varepsilon.
    $$
    Therefore choose
    $$
    \delta = \min\{1,\varepsilon/3\}.
    $$
    Then whenever $0&lt;|x-1|&lt;\delta$, both bounds hold and we get $|x^2-1|&lt;\varepsilon$.
    Hence $\lim_{x\to 1}x^2=1$.
    </p>

<p>
This proof illustrates a standard analysis move: impose an extra condition like $|x-1|&lt;1$ to control a troublesome factor,
then use the remaining freedom to meet the $\varepsilon$ target.

  <li>how quantifiers lead directly to $\varepsilon$–$N$ and $\varepsilon$–$\delta$ proofs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When you begin Real Analysis, the biggest shift is not new formulas, but a new standard of justification.
You will be asked to prove statements that look “obvious” from calculus intuition.
The point is not to deny intuition; it is to learn exactly which facts your intuition depends on, and how to make those dependencies explicit.

<div class="callout">
<strong>How to read an analysis proof.</strong>
When reading a proof, ask:
<ul>
  <li>What are the hypotheses, and where are they used?</li>
  <li>What definition is being invoked (especially one with quantifiers)?</li>
  <li>Which quantities depend on which choices?</li>
  <li>Where do inequalities come from, and what are they trying to control?</li>
</ul>
If you can answer these questions, you are already doing Real Analysis.
</div>

<p class="muted">
A practical suggestion: do not merely read the worked examples. After each one, try to rewrite the argument from memory.
Then compare to the original. The gap between your version and the written version is exactly where your analysis skills are growing.
