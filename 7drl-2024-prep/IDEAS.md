Off-world dino camp

Disaster has struck the off-world camp on the moon Phobos. You have been sent in to investigate, report your findings, and return in 7 days unscathed. You arrive to a camp that looks like smouldering rubble. Buildings destroyed, large sections of fences destroyed, dinosaurs running loose everywhere. You need to power up the camp, rescue any survivors you find, find out what went wrong, and figure out why the dinosaurs are acting so crazy.

Large open map with grid based tiles. Some underground sections. Trains. Flying craft.

Each day should play out like a chapter in a story. 

You become clumsy if you don't sleep and it's dangerous to be moving at night.

The world changes while you sleep. 

6 types of dinos to interact with. 

What is the game loop?

 - Survival mechanics (sleep, hunger, physical weakness, day night cycle)
 - No inventory nonsense
 - Automated terraformer/world building => board game like engine building
